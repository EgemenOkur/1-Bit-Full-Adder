# 1-Bit-Full-Adder
The aim was to design a one bit full adder on RTL level, Gate Level and Behavioural Model. 
Simulating each level with Verilog Code and showing the results.


What is the 1-Bit Full Adder ?
Full Adder is the adder which adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two
inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is
designated as C-OUT and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM.
A full adder logic is designed in such a manner that can take eight inputs together to create
a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to the another.
